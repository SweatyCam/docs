# Rejected Takeoff in the A320

The term rejected takeoff (also known as RTO) refers to incidents in which an aircraft's pilots elect to abort their departure before reaching a critical speed. This critical speed is known as 'V1' or the “decision speed”, and refers to the maximum speed an aircraft can reach on its takeoff roll and still have sufficient space to stop before the end of the runway. When the aircraft surpasses this speed, the aircraft must take-off. 
When the aircraft speed is at or above 100 kt, it may become hazardous to reject a takeoff, therefore a takeoff is split into 3 phases:  

- Below 100 kt  
- Above 100 kt and below V1  
- Above V1

## What happens during a rejected takeoff?

The decision to reject the takeoff and the stop action is made by the Captain, it is therefore recommended that the Captain keeps his hand on the thrust levers until the aircraft reaches V1, whether he is Pilot Flying (PF) or Pilot Not Flying (PNF).

As soon as the Captain decides to abort, he calls “STOP”, takes over control of the aircraft, and performs the stop actions.

## Reasons for a rejected takeoff  

It is not possible to list all the factors that could lead to the decision to reject the takeoff. However, in order to help the Captain make a decision, the ECAM inhibits warnings that are not essential from 80 kt to 1500 ft (or 2 min after lift-off, whichever occurs first). When this occurs, a magenta T.O INHIBIT memo is displayed in the Upper ECAM (E/WD).

- Below 100 kt:  
    - Any ECAM warning/caution should prompt the Captain to seriously consider discontinuing the takeoff
- Above 100 kt and below V1:  
    - Fire warning or severe damage
    - Sudden loss of engine thrust
    - Malfunctions or conditions that give unambiguous indications that the aircraft will not fly safely
    - Any red ECAM warning
    - Any amber ECAM caution listed below:
        - F/CTL SIDESTICK FAULT
        - ENG FAIL
        - ENG REVERSE FAULT
        - ENG REVERSE UNLOCKED
        - ENG 1(2) THR LEVER FAULT
- Above V1:  
    - When the aircraft speed is greater than V1, takeoff must be continued

## Rejected Takeoff Procedure  

!!! note

      Because in the simulator most of the time you are on your own, the procedure has been condensed for a single pilot to perform. In real life operations, the procedures are split between the Captain and FO.

"STOP"................................ANNOUNCE  
THRUST LEVERS.............................IDLE  
REVERSE THRUST.......................MAX AVAIL  
REVERSERS.......................CHECK/ANNOUNCE  
DECELERATION....................CHECK/ANNOUNCE  
AUDIO WARNINGS..........................CANCEL  
                AIRCRAFT STOPPED  
REVERSERS...............................STOWED  
ATC.....................................NOTIFY  
PARKING BRAKE...............................ON  
CABIN CREW...............................ALERT  
ECAM ACTIONS...........................PERFORM

!!! note 

    - Full reverse thrust may be used until coming to a complete stop. But, if there is enough runway available at the end of the deceleration, it is preferable to reduce reverse thrust when passing 70 kt.
    - If the brake response from the autobrake does not seem appropriate for the runway condition, FULL manual braking should be applied and maintained. IF IN DOUBT, TAKE OVER MANUALLY.
