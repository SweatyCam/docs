# Ice and Rain Protection

The A320 is exposed to many types of weather and atmospheric conditions, both in flight and on the ground. These include icing conditions and heavy rain, both of which could be potentially dangerous to the aircraft if they are not managed appropriately.

!!! tip "Icing Conditions"
    Icing conditions on ground and during take-off can be expected when the OAT (Outside Air Temperature) is at or below 10ᵒC and there exists visible moisture on the taxiways and runways such as standing water, slush, ice, or snow which may be ingested.    
    Icing conditions in the air can be expected when the TAT (Total Air Temperature) is at or below 10ᵒC and the aircraft is flying through visible moisture such as cloud, fog with visibility of one mile or less, rain, snow, sleet, or ice crystals.
    
To ensure safe and unrestricted operation of the aircraft in these conditions, the ice and rain protection system has been implemented. This comprises the subsystems listed below:

- [Wing Anti-Ice](#wing-anti-ice)
- [Engine Anti-Ice](#engine-anti-ice) 
- [Window Heat](#window-heat) 
- [Probes Heat](#probes-heat)
- [Rain Removal](#rain-removal)
- [Ice Detection](#ice-detection)

## Wing Anti-Ice
In flight, hot air from the pneumatic system heats the three outboard slats (3-4-5) of each wing.  
Air is supplied through one valve in each wing.  
The WING pushbutton on the ANTI-ICE panel controls the valves.  
When the aircraft is on ground, the flight crew can initiate a 30-second test sequence by turning the system ON.  
If the system detects a leak during normal operation, the affected side’s wind anti-ice valve automatically closes.  
When wing anti-ice is selected, the N1 or EPR limit is automatically reduced, and the idle N1 or EPR limit is automatically increased.  
If the electrical power supply fails, the valves close.

## Engine Anti-Ice
An independent air bleed from the high-pressure compressor protects each engine nacelle from ice. Air is supplied through a two-position (open and closed) valve that the flight crew controls with two pushbuttons, one for each engine.  
The valve automatically closes if air is unavailable (engine not running).  
When an engine anti-ice valve is open, the N1 or EPR limit is automatically reduced and, if necessary, the idle N1 or EPR limit is automatically increased for both engines to provide the required pressure.  
If electrical power fails, the valves open.

## Window Heat
The aircraft uses electrical heating for anti-icing each windshield and demisting the cockpit side windows.  
Two independent Window Heat Computers (WHCs), one on each side, automatically regulate the system, protect it against overheating, and indicate faults.  

Window heating comes on:

- Automatically when at least one engine is running, or when the aircraft is in flight  
- Manually, before engine start, when the flight crew switches ON the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT pushbutton

Windshield heating operates at low power on the ground and at normal power in flight. The changeover is automatic.
Only one heating level exists for the windows.

## Probes Heat
Electrical heating protects:

- Pitot heads  
- Static ports  
- Angle Of Attack (AOA) probes  
- Total Air Temperature (TAT) probes  

Three independent Probe Heating Computers (PHCs) automatically control and monitor:  

- Captain probes   
- F/O probes  
- STBY probes  

They protect against overheating and indicate faults.
The probes are heated:  

- Automatically when at least one engine is running, or when the aircraft is in flight  
- Manually, when the flight crew switches ON the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT pushbutton  

On the ground, the TAT probes are not heated and pitot heating operates at a low level. The changeover to normal power is automatic.

## Rain Removal

### Wipers

Each front windshield has a two-speed electric wiper.
A rotary selector controls each wiper.
Wipers must never be used on a dry windshield.

### Rain Repellent

In moderate to heavy rain, the flight crew can spray a rain repellent liquid on the windshield to improve visibility.
After about 30 seconds, the windows are covered with spray.
Separate pushbuttons control the rain repellent application on each side of the windshield.
Rain repellent must never be used to wash the windshield and must never be used on a dry windshield.

## Ice Detection

### Visual Ice Indicator
An external visual ice indicator is installed between the two windshields. There can also be an external ice detector light.

### Ice Detection System
The ice detection system has two separate ice detector probes on the forward lower section of the fuselage. The probes detect ice accretion.  
They also indicate, through the MEMO display, that icing conditions have disappeared. The system logic generates ECAM messages according to the ice detector signals and the flight crew’s selection of engine or wing anti-icing systems.  
The ice detection system does not control the ENG or WING anti-icing systems.  

## Usage of the Ice and Rain Protection System

### Wing Anti-Ice System
ON GROUND - Can only be used on the ground for a 30-second test sequence  
IN FLIGHT - Must be `ON` when there is visible airframe icing, either on the visual ice indicator or the wipers  

### Engine Anti-Ice System
ON GROUND - Must be `ON` during all ground operations where icing conditions exist or are anticipated  
IN FLIGHT - Must be `ON` during all flight operations where icing conditions exist or are anticipated, except during climb or cruise when the SAT is below -40ᵒC  


### Probe/Window Heat System



| ON GROUND | Windows and probes (except TAT probes) are automatically heated when at least one engine is running |  |
IN FLIGHT  

### Rain Removal System
ON GROUND  
IN FLIGHT  

### Other Procedures
If taxiing in icing conditions, delay the flaps extension until the runway holding point. This prevents contamination in the mechanism.  
If an approach was made in icing conditions, delay the flaps retraction until the ground crew confirms the flaps and slats are clear of ice.
